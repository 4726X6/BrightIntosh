#  BrightIntosh

BrightIntosh enables your MacBook Pro M1 (or newer) to use the increased brightness of its XDR display anytime. By default this is only possible when displaying HDR content. 

## Limitations

Currently the increased brightness is not supported while switching spaces or using mission control.
